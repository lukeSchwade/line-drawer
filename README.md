# line-drawer

Experiment in trying to create program that can slowly draw out an svg file, as if it's being hand-drawn.

Core learning Points
    - How to read and interpret SVG file into xml
    - How to procedurally draw out the line from xml
    - 
I'm going to also attempt a mouse brush canvas for drawing 
    - Need to periodically find location of mouse when its hovering canvas using setInterval
    - on click, draw a circle, at 200ms intervals
    - Algorithm that can interpret and draw a smoothed line from a series of coordinates?
